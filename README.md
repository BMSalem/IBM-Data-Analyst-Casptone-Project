# IBM-Data-Analyst-Casptone-Project
This is the Capstone Project for Course 9, IBM Data Analyst Capstone Project. Part of IBM's Data Analyst Professional Certificate from Coursera.

<h1>Project Overview: Emerging Technology Skills Analysis</h1>
<p>We are taking on the role of a Data Analyst at a leading global IT and business consulting firm. Our organization is committed to maintaining a competitive edge by proactively identifying future skill requirements. We have been tasked with a critical initiative to analyze emerging technology trends to inform this year's strategic report on in-demand skills.</p>
<h2>Data Analysis Workflow</h2>
<p>The project will follow a six-stage data analysis pipeline, moving from data acquisition to final presentation.</p>

<h3>Module 1: Data Acquisition and Ingestion</h3>
<p>The initial phase focuses on collecting data on highly-sought-after technology skills. We will aggregate information from diverse sources, including job postings, industry blog posts, and developer surveys. This process will involve scraping websites and accessing APIs to ingest data in various formats such as CSV, Excel sheets, and database tables.</p>

<h3>Module 2: Data Wrangling and Preparation</h3>
<p>With the raw data collected, we will prepare it for analysis. This involves rigorous data wrangling techniques to ensure data quality, including:</p>
<p>- Identifying and removing duplicates.</p>
<p>- Detecting and handling missing values (e.g., imputation or removal).</p>

<h3>Module 3: Statistical Analysis and Insight Generation</h3>
<p>Once the data is clean, we will apply statistical analysis to extract key insights and trends, focusing on high-priority questions such as:</p>
<p>- Identifying the top programming languages and database skills currently in demand.</p>
<p>- Determining the most popular Integrated Development Environments (IDEs).</p>
<p>- Analyzing demographic data (e.g., age and gender distribution) of developers.</p>

<h3>Module Phase 4: Data Retrieval and Visualization</h3>
<p>This stage combines targeted data retrieval with effective visualization. We will access an SQL database to pull only the necessary data into DataFrames. We will then select and create appropriate visualizations (charts, plots, and histograms) to clearly illustrate our findings and trends.</p>

<h3>Module 5: Interactive Dashboard Development</h3>
<p>To enable dynamic exploration of the data, we will utilize Cognos/Google Looker Studio to build and deploy interactive dashboards. These dashboards will serve as a dynamic tool for further analysis and data presentation.</p>

<h3>Module 6: Final Presentation and Storytelling</h3>
<p>The final step is to synthesize the analysis into a compelling narrative. We will use our data storytelling skills to present the core findings, explain the significance of the identified trends, and provide strategic insights for the organization's future skill planning.</p>
